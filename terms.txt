A Web service is a software application that conforms to the Web Service Interoperability Organization's Basic Profile 1.0.
Main purpose of Web service technologies is to allow applications on different platforms to exchange business data. 
Web service technologies are used for Application-to-Application (A2A) integration or Business-to-Business (B2B) communication.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), WSDL (Web Services Description Language), and
UDDI(Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) are used in concert to provide Web service applications with a type
system (XML), a messaging protocol (SOAP), an interface definition language (WSDL), and a registry for publishing Web services
(UDDI).

XML documents contain the information being exchanged between two parties, while SOAP provides a packaging and routing standard for exchanging XML documents over a network. WSDL allows anorganization to describe the types of XML documents and SOAP
messages that must be used to interact with their Web services. Finally, UDDI allows organizations to register their Web
services in a uniform manner within a common directory, so clients can locate their Web services and learn how to access them.
