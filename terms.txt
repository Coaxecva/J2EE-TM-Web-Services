A Web service is a software application that conforms to the Web Service Interoperability Organization's Basic Profile 1.0.
Main purpose of Web service technologies is to allow applications on different platforms to exchange business data. 
Web service technologies are used for Application-to-Application (A2A) integration or Business-to-Business (B2B) communication.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), WSDL (Web Services Description Language), and
UDDI(Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) are used in concert to provide Web service applications with a type
system (XML), a messaging protocol (SOAP), an interface definition language (WSDL), and a registry for publishing Web services
(UDDI).

XML documents contain the information being exchanged between two parties, while SOAP provides a packaging and routing standard for exchanging XML documents over a network. WSDL allows anorganization to describe the types of XML documents and SOAP
messages that must be used to interact with their Web services. Finally, UDDI allows organizations to register their Web
services in a uniform manner within a common directory, so clients can locate their Web services and learn how to access them.

An XML document may be well formed, but invalid because it is not organized according to its schema.
A schema is used to define elements and attributes in a markup language and verify the correctness of an XML instance;
it's not a computer program.

The names of XML schema types are case-sensitive. When an element declares that it is of a particular type, it must specify
both the namespace and the name of that type exactly as the type declares them.

According to the WS-I Basic Profile 1.0, Web services must support all of the XML schema features.

JAX-RPC maps some of the XML schema built-in types to Java primitives, and basic complex types to Java beans. JAX-RPC can map
most derived complex types to Java beans, but not all. Similar limitations are found in other platforms like .NET and 
SOAP::Lite for Perl.
